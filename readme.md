# About 

![altimage](IMG_5044.JPG)
My name is Siva Sai Bharath Rongali an international graduate student from India. I prefer to call me Bharath. I did my bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering in “Gandhi Institute of Technology and Management” in India. After my under-graduation, I worked as a Software Developer in Accenture solutions pvt. ltd. for one year. I am the part of the team who developed Cigna healthcare web application using Pega technology.

After completion of "Advanced Web Server Program", I think it helps me to become an expert in full-stack developer and helps me to get a good job in any reputed multinational company.

Thank you,
Bharath Rongali
